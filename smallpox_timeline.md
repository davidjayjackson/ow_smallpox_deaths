# Here's some information about the smallpox  pandemic:
* 1796: Dr. Edward Jenner discovers that vaccination with cowpox can protect against smallpox infection. Jenner takes matter from a human smallpox sore and inoculates Phipps with it to test his resistance. Phipps remains in perfect health, making him the first person to be vaccinated against smallpox.
* 1870–1875: The Franco-Prussian War triggers a smallpox pandemic that claims 500,000 lives.
* Since 1900: Smallpox is estimated to have killed more than 300 million people. 
*  Note: The earliest evidence of skin lesions resembling those of smallpox is found on faces of mummies from the time of the 18th and 20th Egyptian Dynasties (1570–1085 BC).
